# **App Name**: N'TaSmart Predictive Maintenance

## Core Features:

- Real-time Data Ingestion: Collect equipment data (temperature, vibration, voltage, current, etc.) in real-time using IoT sensors.
- Anomaly Detection: Analyze sensor data to identify anomalies and deviations from normal operational patterns using AI algorithms.  The reasoning will be a 'tool' used in the feature implementation
- Predictive Failure Analysis: Predict potential equipment failures before they occur using machine learning models trained on historical data. The reasoning will be a 'tool' used in the feature implementation
- Alerting System: Notify technicians of potential equipment failures through a mobile and web interface.
- Equipment Health Dashboard: Display equipment health status in a user-friendly dashboard with key performance indicators.
- Maintenance Scheduling: Facilitate scheduling and planning of maintenance activities based on predicted failures.
- Technician Collaboration: Allow the technicians and experts mentioned in the documentation to seamlessly share insights, diagnostic results, and solutions with other members involved in resolving the specific incident.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#003049) to convey trust and intelligence.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean, modern interface.
- Accent color: Bright cyan (#29ABE2) for alerts and key metrics.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that will communicate a clean modern feel.
- Use clear, easily understandable icons to represent equipment status and alerts.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to both web and mobile devices.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and improve user experience.
